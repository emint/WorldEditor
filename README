WorldEditor is my attempt at creating an easy to use format and editor for creating worlds to use in SDL-backed games.

The idea is to present a GUI through which users can lay down textures and objects which save into a file that can be loaded within their own games. This will, hopefully, allow users to create levels and worlds easily and use them in their games with greater ease.

I imagine a binary format '.wrld' which is defined as follows.

<Version - uint8>
  Version of the .wrld format
<Auxilary - 32 bytes>
  Reserved space for features to come
<World Height - uint32>
  Height of world measured in pixels
<World Width - uint32>
  Width of world measured in pixels
<Texture square width - uint32>
  The width of one texture square. 
<Texture square height - uint32>
  The height of one texture square.

---------------Texture Store--------------
<Texture 1>
<Texture 2>
...
<Texture n>


Definitions:
<Texture i> is a file path starting with known directory 'textures/'

[Much more to come]

Preliminary Features:
Should work with any bitmap the user likes
Should allow users to define collision terrain
Should have easy to use GUI for user to lay out their
  worlds
Should provide easy to use driver to read the .wrld
  format into SDL-backed programs


Next I aim to provide functionality in form of C++ classes to read and use these worlds.
